Hey Aaditya this is written on 23-7-2022. Saturday.

You made this file to write the idea of this project and what to add to make it better.

This is my first project in java.

The core Idea is to make a Matrix calculator such that the whole course of 12^th standard is covered.

--> Main problem:-
           ? to make an application with GUI that covers the entire syllabus of std 12.
           ? use the concepts od OOP to wrap around the problem.
           ?
           ? make it easy and fast.

--> Course to be Covered:-
           ? Matrix <<<////
           ? Matrix Operations
           ? Determinant of Matrix
           ? Inverse of Matrix using Matrix Operation
           ? Inverse of Matrix Using Adjoint of Matrix

--> Current Status:-
           ? Class Matrix() provides functionality to make a 3x3 matrix and print it or make its transpose.
           ? Class InverseMatrix() extends Matrix() and is equipped with all the logic to handle and calculate it's inverse.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TO DO:-

       #### code currently works for 3x3 matrix

 >> make equalsTo() in Matrix for "Matrix matrix" and "float[][] x". <<<////
 >> put all the matrix operations into Matrix, from InverseMatrix. <<<////
 >> test the changes. {during testing I came across the problem of decimal in points} <<<////
 >> Add a smooth GUI. <<<////  ## make the GUI a bit modern



 >> add class for user defined elementary operation. < // I have reached here.
        .
        --> Working.

        > Tried to add a css to the project, but it did not work.

 >> make the GUI a bit modern
 >> add class to calculate inverse matrix from adjoin of matrix.
 >> add a new class to perform matrix multiplication.
    AxB using the rules of multiplication of matrices like -1 rule etc.
 >> Eventually make the app capable to solve matrix equation{this is going to be hard}.
 >> A matrix transpose class is needed which can transpose any matrix.
 >> A class for symmetric and skew symmetric matrix to check for their symmetry and to make any matrix both.
